# Jishing Luoping

Definition: A "brother" or "sister" type that puts up job postings to gather information from applicants.
            Those applicants will not get jobs because the economy is so tough nowadays. Instead, those
            applicants will get harassed by the mob and the police.

For the past few years, Jishing Luoping and I have become best friends. He knows me inside and out because
he has a lot of information on me. I also know many things about him. But we are still both struggling in 
some areas of life but in our own ways. This is a good lesson in the uselessness of knowing some things.
Also, his troubles and my troubles are different, and we don't share them with each other. 

Jishing Luoping is like the character from the South Korean crime thriller, The Man From Nowhere. He is
much respected and adored by people from all walks of life.
